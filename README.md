# split_file_by_key
Given a *SORTED* file, delimiter, and key(s), split the file into numerous out files based on the key(s).

## Requirements
A sorted file based on the same fields you want to split on. So if you want to split on the 7th field in a file, please ensure the file is sorted on that field otherwise you *will lose some of your data.*
